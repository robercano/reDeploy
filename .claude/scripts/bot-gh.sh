# Run gh as a bot machine account, so agent-created PRs are authored by the bot
# and the human repo owner can formally review/approve them — GitHub hard-blocks
# PR authors from approving their own PRs, so PRs created with the owner's gh
# auth are un-approvable by the owner.
#
# Setup (one-time, ~10 min):
#   1. Create a free GitHub machine account (GitHub ToS allows ONE free machine
#      account alongside your personal account). Name it generically, e.g.
#      <you>-assistant-bot, and reuse it across all your repos.
#   2. Add it as a collaborator (write) on each repo it should open PRs in.
#   3. As the bot: Settings → Developer settings → Tokens (classic) → generate
#      with `repo` scope. (Classic, not fine-grained: fine-grained PATs cannot
#      reliably target repos owned by ANOTHER personal account.)
#   4. Put it in the project's .env (gitignored) as GH_BOT_TOKEN=...
#
# Policy: ALL agent `gh` interaction (issue/PR creation, comments, merging, and
# even reads/queries) goes through this wrapper so it runs as the bot. Only `git`
# commits and pushes stay on the owner's auth — that keeps the owner eligible to
# formally approve bot-authored PRs (GitHub blocks a PR author from approving it).
#
# Usage: .claude/scripts/bot-gh.sh pr create --title "..." --body "..."

# `pr create` calls.

# Auto-assign new bot PRs to the repo owner, so the owner gets a notification

# --assignee (or its short form -a) themselves.
#
# Assignment is a SEPARATE follow-up call after `pr create` succeeds, not an
# inline `--assignee` flag on the create itself. Some bot tokens (classic PATs
# scoped to `repo` only, no `read:org`) can create PRs fine but have the
# assignee-resolution step rejected — if that were inline, the whole
# `pr create` would fail and no PR would exist at all. As a follow-up, a
# scope-rejected assignment just leaves the PR unassigned (soft failure,
# warned on stderr) instead of losing the PR.
